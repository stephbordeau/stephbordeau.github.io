          <p>The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy&reg; are founded on an ancient Maya technique of abdominal massage. This technique is performed externally by gently guiding and supporting organs back into their optimal position, allowing for improved functioning for optimal health and wellness.</p>
          <p>Arvigo&reg; Therapy is best known for addressing misalignment or congestion in the reproductive organs of both men and women, as well as many common digestive disorders.  The techniques effectively alleviate tissue congestion and organ constriction to improve the vital flows of energy, blood, lymph and nerves in the abdomen. They address and can release emotional and energetic tension from the abdomen. This assists to prevent the progression of chronic disease symptomology while improving the body’s ability to self repair and balance.</p>
