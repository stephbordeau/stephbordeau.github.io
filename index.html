            As a person with a nurturing and intuitive spirit, becoming a
            massage therapist was a natural progression in my journey. I have
            experienced the deep, profound healing that occurs through regular
            bodywork and wanted to be able to share this incredible healing gift
            with others. I am also a lifelong student of yoga and attribute my
            intuitive touch to years of work towards cultivating a deep
            awareness of Self. My approach to massage is to create a healing
            environment that is safe and nurturing, calming to the nervous
            system, and non judgmental, with intentions to allow pain to release
            from the body&#8226;mind&#8226;spirit. During a session with me, you
            can expect an integrative approach, blending different modalities
            such as Swedish, deep tissue, myofascial release and trigger point
            therapy to achieve your desired healing goals. I also love the
            healing properties of aromatherapy and sound healing and often
            incorporate these complimentary modalities into my sessions to
            create a deeper healing experience for you.

            I am a 2018 Graduate from Gwinnett College graduating Summa Cum
            Laude. While attending school, I also completed my prenatal massage
            certification. I completed my 200-hr Registered Yoga Teacher
            Training in 2013 and later went on to obtain my certification to
            teach prenatal yoga.

            I am honored to be a part of your healing journey and will welcome
            you with an open heart.

          <p><b>Swedish abdominal massage</b> (60 min) is a beautiful way to clear held stress and anxiety that often gives us that uneasy feeling or "knot in the gut". This clearing of stagnant energy brings ease to emotions and is extremely beneficial to our overall digestive system. To amplify the detoxifying effects of the abdominal massage, a castor oil pack will be applied to the abdomen. As you rest and let the castor oil’s healing properties take affect, you will receive a nourishing head/face/neck and foot Swedish massage to further promote circulation and whole body relaxation. The abdominal massage session will conclude with a customized aromatherapy blend designed to calm the nervous system, support gut health, and align the 3rd Chakra.</p>
