        <div class="name">Stephanie Hupp Bordeau</div>
        <div class="title">Licensed Massage and Bodywork Therapist (#17760), RYT-200</div>
        <div>As a person with a nurturing and intuitive spirit, becoming a massage therapist was a natural progression in my journey. I have experienced the deep, profound healing that occurs through regular bodywork and wanted to be able to share this incredible healing gift with others. I am also a lifelong student of yoga and attribute my intuitive touch to years of work towards cultivating a deep awareness of Self. My approach to massage is to create a healing environment that is safe and nurturing, calming to the nervous system, and non judgmental, with intentions to allow pain to release from the body&#8226;mind&#8226;spirit. During a session with me, you can expect an integrative approach, blending different modalities such as Swedish, deep tissue, myofascial release and trigger point therapy to achieve your desired healing goals. I also love the healing properties of aromatherapy and sound healing and often incorporate these complimentary modalities into my sessions to create a deeper healing experience for you.</div>
        <div>I am a 2018 Graduate from Gwinnett College graduating Summa Cum Laude. While attending school, I also completed my prenatal massage certification. I completed my 200-hr Registered Yoga Teacher Training in 2013 and later went on to obtain my certification to teach prenatal yoga.</div>
        <div>I am honored to be a part of your healing journey and will welcome you with an open heart.</div>
